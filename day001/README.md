# Log of day 1

- installed go and setup VS Code for go
- used some go commands for init, mod, run, build, test
- mostly followed her https://golang.org/doc/code but did 'free typing', esp. for the `morestrings` package
- wrote and ran the test (I like that the first *Getting started* includes this part!)
