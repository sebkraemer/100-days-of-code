# Solving Sudoku

This is a work in progress to mess aroung with Go, backtracking and possibly more.
I'm working on this during my #100DaysOfCode.

Some of the work is logged in the [main README starting at day 16](../../log.md#day-16).

# TODOs

- generate valid field as starting point
- solve :)

# Ideas

- brute force vs. backtracking
- profiling // https://golangdocs.com/profiling-in-golang
- benchmarking
- web service
- AWS lambda
