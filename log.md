# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1

November 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**

Installed Go and setup VS Code, followed along the tutorial at https://golang.org/doc/code and the related Youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MXIGYrMk80.

**Thoughts**

I enjoyed getting started. Tools and commands are a lot to grasp at once. Regarding coding, I really noticed how useful it was that I have started with the *Learning Go* book a while ago. I felt I could apply some of the things and did not just copy some content.
